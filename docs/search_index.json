A staggering 78% of people who were hospitalized, needed ventilators or died due to COVID-19 in the USA, were obese/overweight [1]. This observation motivated us to dig deeper into data related to obesity trends in the USA. Through this project, we aim to analyze the underlying trends and contributing factors (Education, Income levels, Race etc.) that lead to obesity in adults. We also wish to study the policy support for healthy food intake, physical activity etc. and its correlation with the actual numbers indicating obesity/overweight classification. In this project, we aim to focus on analysis on answering below questions: Over the years how do the trends look for correlation of obesity with income, physical activity, nutrition intake etc? In recent times, how is obesity distributed across segments of population belonging to different race, gender, age-group etc? How does obesity status vary among different states in the US? How environmental and policy support distributed across the US? Is there a correlation between this support and obesity rates at the state-level?

We also considered looking at Data from the NYC Health website, but decided to go ahead with data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as it provided more granular data, all across the US. 2.1 Datasets The datasets are from Centre for Disease Control’s website. They provide national and state specific data on obesity, nutrition, physical activity. 2.2 Dataset links and description 2.2.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral Link : Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Behavioral Description: This dataset includes data on policy and environmental supports for physical activity, diet etc. Number of records: 76.4K Types and range of variables: Year : 2011-2018 LocationAbbr : US state abbreviations and just “US” for the national level. Also includes overseas US territories like Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands etc. Class: Obesity Status, Nutrition Status, Physical Activity Status Questions: Questions pertaining to a particular class Data_Value: Value pertaining to corresponding Question StratificationCategory1 : Age(years) , Education, Gender, Income, Race/Ethnicity, Total Stratification1: Subcategories within each Stratification1, For example, for the StratificationCategory1 = “Gender”, this will include “Female” and “Male” subcategories Issues discovered: Within the Class “Nutrition Status”, data was only present for the years 2017 and 2019. This made it impossible to use this Class for a meaningful time-series analysis. 2.2.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support Link : Nutrition-Physical-Activity-and-Obesity-Policy Description: This dataset includes data on adult’s diet, physical activity, and weight status from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Number of records: 6.642 K Types and range of variables: Year : 2002-2020 LocationAbbr : US state abbreviations and just “US” for the national level. Also includes overseas US territories like Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands etc. Class: Breastfeeding Support, Nutrition Support, Physical Activity Support, Sugar Drinks Support, Television Viewing Support Questions: Questions pertaining to a particular class Data_Value: Value pertaining to corresponding Question. These maybe numerical or boolean in nature. StratificationCategory1 : Total Issues discovered: Even though the dataset gives the impression of providing data for 18 years, it was very sparsely populated for most years i.e. only 10% of the total records belong to the years 2002-2009 and 2020. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral 3.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support 3.3 Dataset required for interactive visualization", " Chapter 3 Data transformation We exported the datasets in csv format directly from the website links mentioned in Section 2.2. Following describe the steps taken to preprocess the data for use in our analysis. Due to issues mentioned in 2.2, we filtered the data for the years 2011-2019 only. Within each dataset, we discovered a number of variables that either provided redudant information or were out of the scope of our analysis. We removed these. Lastly, we subsetted the data to only include National level and US State-level data, excluding overseas US territories like Puerto Rico. 3.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral 3.1.1 Filtering of columns: Redundant Columns: YearStart and YearEnd columns contained exactly the same values. We retained only YearStart. Data_Value_Type contains no useful information. All values are “Value”. Data_Value and Data_Value_Alt columns contained exactly the same values. We retained only Data_Value. GeoLocation contains location information already captured in LocationAbbr and LocationDesc. Topic and Class contained exactly the same value. We retained only Class. Note: Together, the columns - “Total”, “Age(years)”, “Education”, “Gender”, “Income”, “Race/Ethnicity” contain the same information as present in columns “StratificationCategory1” and “Stratification1”. However, we retained these duplicate columns to enable use in visualizations conforming to etiher pivot or unpivoted data. Columns with mostly NA/empty values: Data_Value_Unit Data_Value_Footnote Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol Columns which were not meaningful for our analysis: Datasource Low_Confidence_Limit High_Confidence_Limit Sample Size ClassID TopicID QuestionID DataValueTypeID LocationID StratificationCategoryID1 StratificationID1 3.1.2 Column transformations: Converted columns “YearStart”,“Class”, “Question”, “StratificationCategory1” and “Stratification1” to factors. Created a new column “QuestionRenamed” from “Question” with shorter question descriptions. Convert “Data_Value” to numeric. 3.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support 3.2.1 Filtering of columns: Redundant Columns: YearStart and YearEnd columns mostly contained the same values, except for 52 rows (0.7% of total data), which contained a one year differed. We retained only YearStart. Data_Value_Type contains no useful information. All values are “Value”. Data_Value and Data_Value_Alt columns contained redundant information, with just slight difference in notation - For example, Yes in Data_Value was mapped to a specific number in Data_Value_Alt. We retained only Data_Value. GeoLocation contains location information already captured in LocationAbbr and LocationDesc. Topic and Class contained exactly the same value. We retained only Class. StratificationCategory1, Stratification1, StratificationCategoryID1, StratificationID1, Total all contain the same value = “Total”. We removed all. Columns with mostly NA/empty values: Data_Value_Unit Data_Value_Footnote Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol Columns which were not meaningful for our analysis: Datasource ClassID TopicID QuestionID DataValueTypeID LocationID 3.2.2 Column transformations: Converted columns “YearStart”,“Class” and “Question” to factors. Created a new column “QuestionRenamed” from “Question” with shorter question descriptions. 3.3 Dataset required for interactive visualization Created a subset of the “Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral” data by combining the Percentage values of Lack of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption into a single number equal to the average value. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral 4.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral This dataset contained two broad categories of missing values - some for which the rows were completely missing from the data, and others which had supplementary text in particular columns explaining that there was missing data for the given row. In above plot, we observed two patterns of missing data. One is where due to “insufficient sample size” (mentioned in the Data_Value_Footnote column) for a given state and Question, some data values are missing. We also noted that within the “Income” StratificationCategory1 group, in the “Stratification1” and “Income” columns, a subcategory called “Data not reported” constituted a small proportion of the entire dataset. In our further analysis, we treat this strata as just another subcategory within “Income”. Apart from these obvious missing patterns, this dataset also has completely missing rows of data across different years. Since these rows are not a part of the dataset explicitly, the above plot failed to capture them. We added rows for these missing values and indicated the Data_Value as missing, to enable us to visualise patterns of these missing values. This is shown in below plot. Data for Nutrition Status i.e. Questions - “No Vegetable Consumption” and “No Fruit Consumption” is missing from 2011-2015 and 2016. Data for four of the Physicial Activity Status Questions is also missing for alternate years starting from 2012 to 2018. Note that above heatmap only captures the missing entries that we explicitly added back - and not the NA values that the previous plot displayed. 4.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support For the Obesity-Policy-Support Dataset, we did a similar analysis. There are no NA values in this dataset. To capture the missing entries over the years, we employed the same technique, as used for the Obesity-Behavioural dataset to generate this heatmap of missing entries. No distinct patterns can be found. However, overall, this dataset seems much more sparse than the Obesity-Behavioural dataset. As compared to 2019, 2018 has lesser number of missing values. Hence, in all our analysis at the state-level for the policy related questions, we used data from 2018 (instead of 2019 which we used from Behavioral Obesity Dataset1) as recent data. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral 5.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral In this dataset, we have data from 2011-2019. This data was utilised to form a time-series graph showing the trends of Obesity Rates over the last decade, in different StratificationCategories and also SubCategories. For each of the Stratification Categories, we can observe a clear upwards trend i.e. as the years have gone by, the obesity rates have increased. The “Total” plot summarises this trend across all Stratification Categories. With the “Age(years)”, “Education”, “Income” and “Race/Ethnicity” Categories, we can see a visible difference in obesity rates of some sub-groups within them (lines located at the bottom part of the graph, ex: College graduates have much lower obesity rates than less educated adults), over the others. In our analysis below, we continue to look deeper into these groups. We can see that middle bars are highest. For lower age group obesity is least - although fruit/vegetable consumption is low, physical activity is higher. As age increases, as expected, the physical activity is the least, although overall nutrition and obesity status are better than middle groups. We observe an overall decreasing trend. Population belonging to higher income levels are found to be more physically active, eat more nutritious food, and also have better obesity status than lower income groups. An overall decreasing trend is apparent. As education level increases, there is more physical activity taking place, more nutritious food being consumed, and more people with higher educationals levels are seen to have a better obesity status. For Asians, the obesity status is the least. The levels of “Lack of Physical Activity” and “Lack of Consumption of Fruits and Vegetables” are not that much higher for Hawaiian/Pacific Island people even though their obesity status is the highest. This could be due to genetic or other factors, not captured in the available datasets. For the sub-categories of 2 or more races, American Indian/Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic Black, we see that they have less nutrition and physical activity than others, and also high obesity status. Until now, we were looking at Total data across the US states. Now let’s look at the data at the state-level and see if we spot any distinctive patterns. We can clearly see that there exists a chain of Southern states, starting from Oklahoma to West Virginia, with the highest Percentage of Obese Adults among all states. Now, let us try to dig deeper into the data for these states - let us look at how they fare in terms of Physical Activity and Nutrition, and if we can find an association with their corresponding Obesity Rates. The first thing we can notice that the overall trend for “Lack of Physical Activity” and “Lack of Consumption of Fruits and Vegetables” mirrors the overall trend of Obesity / Weight Status, especially for the upper half the graph which represents states with the Highest obesity percentages in the US. Combining our findings from the previous geo-plot, we find that the Southern States that showed up as having highest obesity rates also seem to be doing worse than other states in terms of Physical Activity and Nutrition - their rates of the Lack of Physical Activty and the Lack of Fruit/Vegetable Consumption are higher than other states. From this dataset, our broad conclusions are: 1. Overall increasing trend of Obesity regardless of Stratification Category, over the past decade 2. Some sub-groups within each Stratification Category are doing better with their Obesity Status than others. In most cases, this is correlated with their lower rates of Lack of Physical Activty and Nutrition Intake. 3. Southern states in the US have the highest Obesity Rates. This seems to be closely associated with their higher rates of Lack of Physical Activity and Nutrition Intake. 5.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support Majority of the states (30) containing exactly 1 Policy Encouraging Better Nutrition in that state. Only 5 out of 41 states contained &gt;=2 policies supporting better nutrition. In the States that do have Food Policy Councils, most of them seem to have quite a low number - four or less. Most states have exacty 1 Policy that Encourages Physical Activity. Around one-third of the states have no policy at all. Very few states have any policy regarding Restricting Television Viewing (7). All the other states have no such policies. From the histograms, we observed the distribution of number of policies at the state-level. From this geo-plot, we can see exactly which state has how many policies supporting each of the Classes - Nutrition, Physical Activity and Television Viewing. From the right-bottom graph, which sums up total number of policies from all three Classes per state, we observe that it is mostly Southern states like New Mexico, Tennessee, Mississippi, North Carolina etc. Therefore, we would expect these states to do better than others in terms of their Obesity rates. We also had data regarding Breastfeeding Support in terms of the “Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC)” score as well as the Percent of live births occurring at facilities designated as “baby friendly” by the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI). Since the mPINC score is also out of 100, we took an average of these scores per state to plot this graph. We do not observe a particular region in the US to be doing significantly better than others in providing Policy Support For BreastFeeding. From this dataset, our broad conclusions are: 1. States have most number of policies encouraging Good Nutrition Intake, followed by Physical Activity and lastly Television Viewing, which is hardly restricted in the US. 2. Breastfeeding Policy Support Data across states does not seem to follow a discernable pattern in terms of more or less support in a particular US region. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component In this component, we would do a time-series plot of Obesity Status, Physical Activity Status, and Nutrition Status at the State-level instead of the Total level (done in section 2). We can observe that there are some states with fairly lower rates of increase in obesity levels over the years. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.0.1 Limitations In the “Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral” dataset, there was a column named “Sample Size” which had a different value for every Data Value provided in the dataset. This meant that since it was not a single sample from which all the numbers in the data were derived. Therefore we could not perform any analysis to see the proportions of population belonging to each of the Stratifications within the StratificationCategories. This analysis would have been useful to understand which strata of the society are contributing the most to higher obesity levels over the years. Due to the sparsity of “Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support” across the years, in the past decade, we were unable to analyse time-series trends for the policies supporting the different classes - BreastFeeding, Nutrition Intake, Physical Activity and Television Viewing. 7.0.2 Future Scope We could aim to root cause underlying factors responsible for the visible gaps observed in Obesity Rates among sub-cateogires of StratificationCategories. For example, Asians were observed to have a lower obesity rate although their “Lack of Fruit and Vegetable Consumption” and “Lack of Physical Activity” levels were comparable to other “Race/Ethnicity” groups which had much higher obesity rates. Factors like genetics, underlying health conditions of the sub-group etc. could possible provide explanations for such observations.We could join our data with datasets providing valuable information about these We could research associations between COVID hospitalizations, deaths,intensity of COVID symptoms etc. with this obesity data using additional COVID-related datasets. In Section 6, we noted that states did show some variations in levels of increase in Obesity Status, Physical Activity Status, and Nutrition Status over the years. It would be interesting to broadly categorise states into 2 categories - states with steep increases in obesity rates over the years, almost constant to low levels of increase in obesity rates. It would be then worth taking a deeper dive into these states and exploring the reasons behing these differences. "]]
