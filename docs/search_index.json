[["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral 5.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Dataset 1 Obesity-Behavioral In this dataset, we have data from 2011-2019. This data was utilised to form a time-series graph showing the trends of Obesity Rates over approx. the last decade, in different StratificationCategories and also SubCategories. For each of the Stratification Categories, we can observe a clear upwards trend i.e. as the years have gone by, the obesity rates have increased. The “Total” plot summarises this trend across all Stratification Categories. With the “Age(years)”, “Education”, “Income” and “Race/Ethnicity” Categories, we can definitely see a visible difference in obesity rates of some sub-groups within them (lines located at the bottom part of the graph, ex: College graduates have much lower obesity rates than less educated adults), over the others. In our analysis below, we continue to look deeper into these groups. We can see that middle bars are highest. For lower age group obesity is least - although fruit/vegetable consumption is low , physical activity is higher. As age increases, as expected, the physical activity is the least, although overall nutrition and obesity status are better than middle groups. We observe an overall decreasing trend. Population belonging to higher income levels are found to be more physically active, eat more nutritious food, and also have better obesity status than lower income groups. An Overall decreasing trend is apparent. As education level increases, there is more physical activity taking place, more nutritious food being consumed, and more people with higher educationals levels are seen to have a better obesity status. For Asians, the obesity status is the least. The levels of lack of fruit/vegetable consumption and lack of physical activity are not that much higher for Hawaiian/Pacific Island people even though their obesity status is the highest. This could be due to genetic or other factors, not captured in the available data. For 2 or more races, American Indian/Alaska Native, Non-Hispanic black -&gt; they have less nutrition and physical activity than others, and also high obesity status. *** Until now, we were looking at Total data across the US states. Now let’s look at the data at the state-level and see if we spot any distinctive patterns. We can clearly see that there exists a chain of Southern states, starting from Oklahoma to West Virginia, with highest Percentage of Obese Adults. Now, let us try to dig deeper into the data for these states - let us look at how they fare in terms of Physical Activity and Nutrition. The first thing we can notice that the overall trend for Lack of Physical Activity and Lack of Consumption of Fruits and Vegetable mirrors the overall trend of Obesity / Weight Status, especially for the upper half the graph which represents states with the Highest obesity percentages in the US. Combining our findings from the previous geo-plot, we find that the Southern States that showed up as having highest obesity rates also seem to be doing worse than other states in terms of Physical Activity and Nutrition - their rates of the Lack of Physical Activty and the Lack of Fruit/Vegetable Consumption are higher than other states. *** Therefore, from this dataset, our broad conclusions are: 1. Overall increasing trend of Obesity regardless of Stratification Category, over the past decade 2. Some sub-groups within each Stratification Category are doing better with their Obesity Status than others. In most cases, this is correlated with their lower rates of Lack of Physical Activty and Nutrition Intake. 3. Southern states in the US have the highest Obesity Rates. This seems to be closely associated with their higher rates of Lack of Physical Activty and Nutrition Intake. 5.2 Dataset 2 Obesity-Policy-Support ## [1] &quot;0&quot; ## [1] &quot;8&quot; "]]
