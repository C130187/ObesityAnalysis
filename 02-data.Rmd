# Data sources

The starting point for choosing our datasets came from reading the article mentioned in the Introduction section. 
We also considered looking at Data from the NYC Health website, but decided to go ahead with data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as it provided more granular data, all across the US. 

## Datasets

The datasets are from Centre for Disease Controlâ€™s website. They provide national and state
specific data on obesity, nutrition, physical activity.
